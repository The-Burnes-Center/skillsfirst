With development of DNP programs, this new degree will become the preferred preparation for specialty nursing practice."  "The DNP is a graduate degree and is built upon the generalist foundation acquired through a baccalaureate or advanced generalist master’s in nursing."	The source text states that advanced practice nursing education has traditionally required at least an MSN and is transitioning to a DNP, both of which are graduate-level credentials, making a graduate/professional degree an explicit prerequisite for entering an Advanced Practice Nurse role.	0.78	1,024.00

Licensure requires graduation from an accredited RN program, and one of the accepted program types is a hospital-based diploma that confers no college degree; therefore a college degree (Associate’s or higher) is not mandatory for initial licensure.	0.85	1,239.00

It notes: “If you have a degree closely related to HVAC, this experience can be reduced to two years,” indicating a degree is optional, not required.

The text repeatedly states that applicants must possess at least a baccalaureate (bachelor’s) degree to sit for the CPA exam, and licensure builds on this by adding the 150-credit requirement, but it never mandates a master’s or other graduate degree. Thus the minimum explicit requirement is a bachelor's degree.	0.85	856

Certified Public Accountant	https://www.suffolk.edu/business/degrees-programs/accounting/graduate/master-of-science-in-accounting/state-by-state-cpa-exam-eligibility-requirements?ref=map	Could Not Determine	"Based upon our research, Suffolk University’s AACSB accredited online and hybrid MSA programs appear to meet New Jersey’s educational requirements."	The text merely states that Suffolk’s Master of Science in Accounting seems to satisfy New Jersey’s requirements but does not specify that New Jersey explicitly requires a master’s, bachelor’s, associate’s, or any degree at all for CPA licensure, leaving the actual minimum degree level unclear.	0.3	761

The source text discusses proposed legislative changes and general conversations about credit hours and degrees but never states an explicit or implicit degree requirement for obtaining a CPA license in New Jersey.	0.87	751
Certified Public Accountant	https://www.ramapo.edu/msac/4plus1/	No Degree Found	The only licensure-related statement is: “The five-year program meets the 150 credit requirement for New Jersey CPA certification.”  The text does not state that a bachelor’s, master’s, or any specific degree is mandated for CPA licensure—only a total credit count.	The SourceText references a 150-credit requirement for CPA certification but never specifies that holding a bachelor’s, master’s, or other college degree is required, so no explicit or implicit degree requirement can be confirmed from this text alone.	0.83	746

No educational prerequisites for obtaining the Certified Rehabilitation Counselor credential itself are provided.

The text sets out an examination requirement and references an applicant's "graduate degree program," but it never states that completion of such a degree (or any degree) is required for initial licensure.

Although the text mentions a master’s program whose students may sit for the CRC examination, it never explicitly ties attainment of that or any other degree to eligibility for the Certified Rehabilitation Counselor credential.

The provided text details multiple credential levels and their prerequisites but never specifies or implies the need for any college degree, indicating that no degree is required for initial ministerial licensure.	0.88	1,018.00
Clergy License	https://www.abcnj.net/perspective-pastors/ordination-procedures	No Degree Found	“The educational standard of four years of college and three years of seminary (the B.A. and M.Div.

Experience… may be granted on the basis of two years of satisfactory professional growth… for every one year of academic preparation that is lacking.”	Although a BA and M.Div. are described as the normal path, the text explicitly allows applicants to substitute sufficient professional experience for any or all of the academic preparation, meaning a candidate can be ordained (and thus licensed for ministry) without holding any college degree. Therefore no degree is strictly required.	0.63	973
Clergy License	https://utsnyc.edu/academics/career-paths/ordination-process/	No Degree Found	“Track III: Lay Pastor (regional or seminary lay pastor program… plus 3 years of full-time ministry experience)” ; “Apprentice Track – completion of a program of study of at least 250 contact hours approved by the Region of care.”	The text lists multiple routes to ordination/licensure. Several routes (e.g., Lay Pastor Track, Apprentice Track) require only specific training hours or experience and do NOT mandate an associate, bachelor’s, or graduate degree. Since at least one accepted path omits any college degree, a degree cannot be considered a universal prerequisite for obtaining a clergy license.	0.82	930
Clergy License	https://njarmyguard.com/chaplains	Explicit Graduate/Professional	“Chaplains applicants must possess a Master of Divinity degree from an accredited program recognized by the Department of Defense.”	The SourceText clearly states that a Master of Divinity—an advanced graduate theological degree—is required, so the minimum educational prerequisite is an explicit graduate/professional degree.	0.95	928

Clinical Laboratory Technician License	https://www.raritanval.edu/career-training/health-professions/medical-laboratory-technology	No Degree Found	The SourceText only describes an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) educational program and its curriculum; it never states that obtaining a New Jersey Clinical Laboratory Technician license requires any specific degree.	Because the text contains no licensing section or language linking a degree to licensure, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that a degree is required for initial licensure.	0.86	1,012.00

Clinical Laboratory Technician License	https://www.mccc.edu/mltp/	Could Not Determine	The text only describes Mercer County Community College’s Medical Laboratory Technology program and notes it awards an “Associate in Applied Science (A.A.S.) degree,” but it never states that the New Jersey Clinical Laboratory Technician license requires this (or any) degree.	While an associate-degree program is mentioned, the source does not connect that degree to a statutory or regulatory licensure requirement, so the minimum education for licensure cannot be concluded from this text alone.	0.32	918

Clinical Laboratory Technician License	https://www.mccc.edu/mltp/petition.shtml	No Degree Found	The text describes petition criteria (course grades, GPA, health records, background check) but never states that an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree—or completion of a 2-year or 4-year degree program—is required for licensure.	Because the source only details course and procedural requirements for entering a program and makes no mention of any degree prerequisite, there is no evidence of a required college degree for initial licensure.	0.9	878
Clinical Laboratory Technician License	https://www.mccc.edu/mltp/pdf/TuitionCosts.pdf	Could Not Determine	The text only describes the "MEDICAL LABORATORY TECHNOLOGY Program AAS" at Mercer County Community College (tuition, textbooks, course list) and makes no statement that completion of this AAS, or any degree, is required for the New Jersey Clinical Laboratory Technician license.	The source material is a college program cost/course outline and does not set forth the licensure requirements issued by the state; therefore the minimum degree needed for licensure cannot be concluded from the text.	0.35	837
Clinical Laboratory Technician License	https://www.raritanval.edu/general-information/newsroom/become-medical-lab-tech-through-our-partnership-labcorp	No Degree Found	The source text discusses an associate degree program offered by RVCC but never states that a specific degree is required for obtaining a New Jersey Clinical Laboratory Technician license; it provides no licensing‐requirement language at all.	The article is a college promotional piece describing an A.A.S. program and scholarship partnership, not a regulatory document.

Completion of the educational program required for subcode official.”  “The program shall provide at least 45 contact hours of instruction.”  No portion of section (o) or the surrounding provisions specifies that applicants must hold an Associate’s, Bachelor’s, or Graduate/Professional degree.	The licensure pathway for a Construction Official is based on holding lower-level inspector licenses and completing a 45-hour educational program; the text lists contact-hour coursework but never mentions any college degree requirement, either explicit or implicit.	0.88	1,182.00
Construction Official License	https://regulations.justia.com/states/new-jersey/title-5/chapter-23/subchapter-5/section-5-23-5-7/	No Degree Found	“Ten years in construction, design or supervision as a journeyman in a skilled construction trade …; or 10 years as a technical inspector; or 10 years as a construction contractor …” (a)3.i	The regulations allow an applicant to qualify solely through 10 years of relevant experience with no mention of any college degree.

Construction Official License	https://regulations.justia.com/states/new-jersey/title-5/chapter-23/subchapter-5/section-5-23-5-4/	No Degree Found	The section describing eligibility to hold the position states only: “No person shall be appointed to, or shall hold, the position of construction official … unless that person has received a license required for that position pursuant to this subchapter,” without listing any college-degree prerequisite. References to degrees appear solely as optional qualifications that waive trainee experience (e.g., a bachelor’s or associate’s degree can exempt experience for trainee employment) and as requirements for separate intern positions, not for the Construction Official license itself.	The text outlines that a Construction Official must hold the appropriate license but never specifies that obtaining that license requires an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree; degrees are mentioned only in contexts unrelated to mandatory licensure requirements.	0.85	1,107.00
Construction Official License	https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-jersey/N-J-A-C-5-23-5-4	No Degree Found	"No person shall be appointed to, or shall hold, the position of construction official ... unless that person has received a license required for that position..." — the provision sets a licensing requirement but lists no Associate’s, Bachelor’s, or Graduate degree prerequisite for obtaining that license.	The regulation outlines that a license is necessary to serve as a Construction Official but, unlike the trainee/intern sections, it never specifies any college-degree requirement for obtaining that license. Therefore, based on the provided text alone, no college degree is required.	0.86	1,065.00

The statute provides multiple alternative pathways to qualify; one allows certification with 10 years of experience and no mention of any college degree, so a degree is not a mandatory prerequisite for licensure.	0.88	1,030.00

Seven years of experience…” (no degree mentioned in this option, providing a non-degree pathway to licensure).	Because an applicant can qualify solely through seven years of relevant experience without holding any college degree, a degree is not mandatory for initial licensure.	0.88	959
Construction Official License	https://nj.gov/dca/codes/publications/pdf_licensing/mdi_bklet.pdf	No Degree Found	The handbook lists and gives educational requirements only for "Inspector of Hotels and Multiple Dwellings, Trainee", "Inspector of Hotels and Multiple Dwellings", and "Housing Code Official"; there is no section or language specifying any educational prerequisite for a separate "Construction Official" license.	Within the provided text, the Construction Official license is mentioned only incidentally in sample affidavits, and no degree (associate, bachelor’s, or higher) is required or even discussed for obtaining that license; thus no college-degree requirement can be found.	0.86	952

Construction Official License	https://catalog.essex.edu/course-descriptions/ucc/	No Degree Found	"This course is designed to satisfy the educational requirement for licensure as a Construction Official."  – The text lists a single 3-credit course as fulfilling the educational requirement and nowhere mentions an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree.	The source sets out a specific course that satisfies the educational prerequisite for the Construction Official license and does not reference any college degree level.

The text offers multiple qualification routes for personnel performing moderate-complexity testing, including one that only requires a high-school diploma plus training. Because a candidate can qualify without an Associate’s, Bachelor’s, or higher degree, a college degree is not mandatory for this license based on the provided source.	0.83	1,208.00

Engineer-In-Training	https://pdh-pro.com/pe-resources/continuing-education-requirements-for-new-jersey-engineers/	Explicit Bachelor's	“First, the candidate must hold a four-year degree from an engineering program that is accredited.”	The text clearly states that obtaining the credential path (which includes becoming an Engineer-in-Training) begins with holding a four-year accredited engineering degree, an explicit bachelor-level requirement.	0.73	1,063.00
Engineer-In-Training	https://www.harborcompliance.com/engineer-license-requirements-registration	Explicit Bachelor's	- "Prerequisites typically include:  - A four-year engineering degree from an ... accredited college or university program with a degree in engineering." - Key term: "EIT (Engineer in Training) – A professional designation granted upon having completed at least 3 years of school at an ABET-accredited university and having passed the FE exam."	The prerequisites section expressly lists a four-year engineering degree—i.e., a bachelor’s—as part of the path followed to obtain engineering credentials, and the EIT definition further ties the designation to substantial ABET-accredited university study. Together these passages indicate that earning a bachelor-level engineering degree is an explicit educational requirement for the Engineer-in-Training credential.	0.68	1,049.00
Physical Therapist Assistant License	https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/pt/pages/faq.aspx	Implicit Associate's	“Licensing requirements for a physical therapist assistant include having completed a two-year physical therapist assistant program … from an accredited college or university …” (N.J.A.C. 13:39A-5.2)	The text requires completion of a two-year PTA program at an accredited college/university—characteristic of an associate-level credential—without explicitly naming the degree, satisfying the Implicit Associate’s category.	0.78	1,186.00
Engineer-In-Training	https://www.princeton.edu/~asce/FE%20Exam%20Handout.pdf	Explicit Bachelor's	"Apply to the state board to receive your EIT certificate. You will need to have passed the exam and received your ABET-accredited degree."	An ABET-accredited engineering degree is the standard four-year bachelor’s program used for licensure; the text makes receipt of that degree a prerequisite for the EIT certificate, indicating a bachelor’s degree requirement.	0.8	1,034.00
Engineer-In-Training	https://ncees.org/exams/fe-exam/	No Degree Found	The New Jersey section states only that “The board does not require FE examinees to submit an application or an additional fee prior to registering with NCEES…” and provides no mention of any associate, bachelor’s, or graduate degree requirement for Engineer-in-Training certification.	The text covering New Jersey lists administrative steps for taking the FE exam but never specifies that a candidate must hold, be pursuing, or complete any college degree. Since no explicit or implicit degree requirement appears, the correct classification is “No Degree Found.”	0.81	1,026.00

Applicants must submit proof of the EIT certification and the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam results.”  The text specifies the FE exam but does not state any college degree prerequisite for obtaining the EIT certification itself.

Engineer-In-Training	https://njspe.org/2019/11/21/qualifications-you-must-meet-to-become-a-professional-engineer/	Explicit Bachelor's	"A four-year bachelor’s degree in an EAC/ABET-accredited engineering program must be obtained."; "A TAC/ABET-accredited engineering technology programs of four or more years is acceptable also if six years of full-time experience..."	The text plainly states that a four-year bachelor’s degree (or a comparable four-year engineering technology program) is required, indicating an explicit Bachelor’s-level educational prerequisite.	0.85	1,003.00
Engineer-In-Training	https://engineering.rowan.edu/programs/civilenvironmental/current/fe-exam.html	Implicit Bachelor's	"To complete the application, you must ... send your official transcript and a letter from the college verifying academic status and anticipated graduation date to the State Board."  /  "The exam covers a comprehensive range of topics taught in EAC/ABET, Inc. accredited B.S. engineering degree program."	Applicants are required to provide a college transcript and proof of anticipated graduation, and the material is framed around an ABET-accredited B.S. engineering program, implying that enrollment in (or completion of) a bachelor-level engineering degree is necessary even though the text never states the requirement in those exact words.	0.65	990
Engineer-In-Training	https://soe.rutgers.edu/student-experience/career-development/professional-licensing	Explicit Bachelor's	"To become licensed, engineers must complete a four-year college degree..." ; "Students should consider taking the FE examination in New Jersey during the last term before graduating."	The source explicitly states that engineers seeking licensure must complete a four-year college degree, which is a bachelor’s. Although the FE/EIT exam can be taken near graduation, the text still mandates completion of the 4-year degree for the licensing path, making a bachelor’s degree an explicit prerequisite.	0.7	984
Engineer-In-Training	https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-jersey/N-J-A-C-13-40-2-2	Could Not Determine	"An applicant may satisfy this requirement if he or she submits ... an engineer-in-training certificate issued by the Board pursuant to N.J.A.C."  –  the text references the certificate but never states what educational level is required to obtain it.	The excerpt details educational requirements for a Professional Engineer license, not for the Engineer-In-Training certificate itself. Because the excerpt provides no specific education prerequisites for obtaining the EIT certificate, the minimum degree requirement for that license cannot be determined from this text alone.	0.25	966
Engineer-In-Training	https://info.csc.state.nj.us/jobspec/16302.htm	No Degree Found	"An Engineer-In-Training (EIT) certification ... may be substituted for the above education requirement."  The text gives no educational prerequisites for obtaining the EIT itself; it only notes its acceptance in lieu of a degree for this job.	The passage references the EIT certification only as an alternative credential for a job; it does not specify any degree that must be earned to obtain the EIT license, so no degree requirement can be identified from the provided text.	0.85	946
Engineer-In-Training	https://www.stevens.edu/program/engineering-management-bachelor-degree	Implicit Bachelor's	"During senior year, students are eligible to take the Engineer In Training (EIT) exam."	The only eligibility condition mentioned ties taking the EIT exam to being in the senior year of a four-year Bachelor of Engineering program, implicitly indicating that EIT applicants must be enrolled in (and nearly finished with) a bachelor-level engineering degree, even though completion of the degree is not explicitly required in the text.	0.6	919
Engineer-In-Training	https://engineersealstamps.com/blogs/info/new-jersey-pe-seal-requirements-unraveled-your-ultimate-guide	Explicit Bachelor's	"Individuals must graduate from an accredited engineering program or have an equivalent education."	The text states that applicants must graduate from an accredited engineering program—language that, in licensing contexts, refers to an ABET-accredited 4-year engineering (bachelor’s) program. This matches the rule that such phrasing counts as an explicit bachelor’s requirement.	0.75	905
Engineer-In-Training	https://info.csc.state.nj.us/jobannouncements/DefaultJobAnnouncement/ViewNonCompetitiveJobDescription?guid=63f9f56d-5e21-4032-abcd-2b2e3665e2dc	No Degree Found	The text only states: "An Engineer - In - Training (EIT) certification ... may be substituted for the above education requirement." It provides no educational prerequisites for obtaining the EIT certification itself.	The source discusses degree requirements for a job and notes that holding an EIT certificate can replace a bachelor’s degree for that job, but it never specifies any degree needed to obtain the EIT license; therefore, no college degree requirement is identified for the license in this text.	0.85	888
Engineer-In-Training	https://civil.njit.edu/fe-exam-and-review	Explicit Bachelor's	"The exam is intended for students who have recently completed or are near completion of their undergraduate engineering degree at an accredited program."	The text ties eligibility for the FE exam—the prerequisite for Engineer-In-Training status—to completion or near-completion of an accredited undergraduate engineering degree, which is universally a bachelor’s program, satisfying the Explicit Bachelor’s criterion.	0.7	878
Engineer-In-Training	https://dot.nj.gov/transportation/careers/pdf/jobpostings/Job_Post_25-00107.pdf	No Degree Found	The text only notes that "An Engineer-In-Training (EIT) certification ... may be substituted for the above education requirement" and that applicants must submit EIT certification and FE exam results; it never states any degree requirement to obtain the EIT certification itself.	While the job posting requires a Bachelor’s in Civil Engineering, it treats the EIT credential as an alternative but provides no educational prerequisite for earning the EIT license. Therefore, based solely on the provided text, no college degree requirement for initial EIT licensure is stated.	0.85	852
Engineer-In-Training	https://www.sru.edu/documents/academics/online-learning/Engineer%20Licensing%20Requirements%20by%20State.pdf	Could Not Determine	The New Jersey section details only the education and experience needed for a full Professional Engineer license. It contains no description of the qualifications for an Engineer-In-Training certificate or enrollment.	Because the source text is silent on Engineer-In-Training requirements in New Jersey, no conclusion can be drawn about whether a college degree is mandated for that credential.	0.3	799
Engineer-In-Training	https://engineerboards.com/threads/pe-requirements-in-new-jersey.3652/	No Degree Found	The discussion focuses on New Jersey’s EXPERIENCE requirements for PE licensure (e.g., “only counts the experience obtained UNDER IMMEDIATE SUPERVISION of a PE… or three years, if have an MS degree”) and how references must be PEs; nowhere does the text specify that an Engineer-In-Training applicant must hold an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree.

(listed as a requirement "for the PE exam", not for obtaining the Engineer-in-Training title itself) ; "Completed four years of engineering experience as an engineer-in-training (EIT) under a PE." (mentions holding EIT status but gives no educational prerequisite for obtaining it)	The text ties the four-year degree requirement to eligibility for the PE exam, not to the initial issuance of an Engineer-in-Training license. No separate educational prerequisite for becoming an EIT is stated, leaving the degree requirement for that license ambiguous.	0.35	778

The only mentions of eligibility for the Engineer-in-Training/FE path come from forum participants and directly conflict—one states an ABET Bachelor’s is mandatory, another says it is not. No authoritative, unambiguous Board language about EIT educational prerequisites appears, so the minimum degree requirement cannot be confidently determined from the text.	0.3	760

The text specifies an apprenticeship and journeyman experience as prerequisites but never references any college degree; therefore, no degree is required for initial licensure.	0.9	1,172.00
Licensed Social Worker	https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/sw	Explicit Graduate/Professional	“More specifically, the board certifies at the bachelors level and licenses at the masters level.”	The text clearly distinguishes that licensure (including the Licensed Social Worker level) is at the “masters level,” which explicitly signals a requirement for a master’s-degree education.	0.85	1,172.00
Licensed Social Worker	https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/sw/Pages/Supervised-Clinical-Experience.aspx	Explicit Graduate/Professional	"...subsequent to earning a master's degree in social work."	The text explicitly states that the supervised clinical experience required for the license occurs only after the applicant has earned a master’s degree in social work, so an MSW (graduate degree) is a prerequisite for licensure.	0.85	1,172.00

W-2s... your journeyman year in the HVACR trade with practical hands-on experience; College transcript representing your completion of your bachelor..."  Because apprenticeship/journeyman documentation is presented as an alternative to a bachelor’s transcript, the text does not mandate any college degree.	Although a bachelor’s transcript may be submitted, the text also allows applicants to qualify through an apprenticeship and journeyman pathway, demonstrating that a college degree is not required for initial licensure.	0.6	1,170.00

Respiratory Care Practitioners License	https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/resp/Pages/default.aspx	No Degree Found	"allowing applicants who pass the Certified Respiratory Therapy ("CRT") examination … to apply for a plenary license as a respiratory care therapist in the State of New Jersey."  The text lists exam passage, application submission, and background check but nowhere states that an associate's, bachelor's, or graduate degree is required.	The only stated prerequisite for initial licensure is passing the CRT (or RRT) exam; no educational degree of any level is referenced, either explicitly or implicitly, so the minimum degree requirement cannot be inferred.	0.88	1,170.00
Mammography Certification	https://nj.gov/dep/rpp/mam/pers_req.htm	No Degree Found	- Radiologic Technologist initial requirements are:    • "Must be State licensed ...; and    • Must have completed at least 40 contact hours of documented training specific to mammography..." (The text lists only licensing and training hours; it does not state any Associate’s, Bachelor’s, or higher degree requirement.)	For the personnel category most directly tied to performing mammography (Radiologic Technologist), the initial requirements mention only state licensure and specific training hours, with no explicit or implicit college-degree requirement. Therefore a degree is not required for obtaining mammography certification according to the provided text.	0.73	1,169.00

Completed 270 hours of alcohol and drug education;" (no degree language appears anywhere in the listed prerequisites).	The rule lists only specific training hours, work experience, and examinations for certification; it never requires or references an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree, so no college degree is required for initial certification.	0.9	1,167.00
Registered Pharmacist License	https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/phar/Pages/FAQ.aspx	Explicit Bachelor's	"Graduated with either a degree of Bachelor of Science in pharmacy with a minimum five-year course of study, or with a Doctor of Pharmacy;"	The text directly states that to obtain initial pharmacist licensure (at least for foreign graduates) an applicant must possess a Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy (5-year program) or a Doctor of Pharmacy. Because a Bachelor’s degree is explicitly listed as an acceptable credential, the minimum explicit degree requirement is at the Bachelor’s level.	0.88	1,167.00

The text specifies two pathways to obtain the Airframe and Powerplant (mechanic) certificate—graduation from an FAA-approved Aviation Maintenance Technician School or specified months of practical experience.

The training course is 90 hours, consisting of 50 classroom hours and 40 clinical hours.”  No part of the text references an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree requirement for certification.	The source outlines a specific 90-hour training program and competency exams as the pathway to certification, with no mention of any college degree. Therefore, the minimum educational requirement does not include a post-secondary degree.	0.9	1,166.00
Landscape Architect	https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/land/Pages/Licensee-Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx	Explicit Bachelor's	"An applicant for licensure as a landscape architect shall hold a bachelor's or higher degree in landscape architecture from an accredited curriculum from a college or university"; "An applicant for licensure must have a bachelor's or high degree in landscape architecture from a university having a landscape architecture curriculum accredited by the Landscape Architectural Accreditation Board"	The text explicitly states that applicants must hold at least a bachelor's degree in landscape architecture from an accredited program, satisfying the criteria for an Explicit Bachelor's requirement.	0.95	1,166.00

The regulation lists supervised training, work experience, and exams for CADC applicants but never states that an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree is required; therefore the minimum educational requirement appears to be below college-degree level.	0.83	1,165.00
Professional Nurse	https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/nur/Pages/Continuing-Education-FAQ.aspx	No Degree Found	"Has graduated from a board-approved education program; or has graduated from an international education program..." — no mention of associate, bachelor’s, or graduate degree is made anywhere in the provided text.

Do you hold a Baccalaureate Degree from an accredited college or university in a program which is accredited by the National Environmental Health Science and Protection Accreditation Council?”	The application directly asks whether the applicant has completed and holds a baccalaureate degree, indicating that possession of a bachelor’s degree is an explicit prerequisite for sitting for the Registered Environmental Health Specialist examination.	0.82	1,163.00
Fire Inspector Certification	https://www.nj.gov/dca/resources/Certification-Recertification%20Requirements%202020.pdf	No Degree Found	“Fire Inspector Certification: Initial training is the successful completion of the Division of Fire Safety 110-hour Fire Inspector course with successful completion of the Course, Written Exam, and Skills Exam for the Fire Inspector 1 state certification.”	The listed requirement is completion of a 110-hour state Fire Inspector course and exams; the text contains no reference to any associate, bachelor’s, or graduate degree prerequisite.	0.9	1,162.00

The text clearly states that applicants must possess at least a Bachelor's degree (or higher) in Architecture from a NAAB-accredited institution, making a bachelor's degree the explicit minimum educational prerequisite for licensure.	0.95	1,161.00
Tax Collector Certificate	https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/dlgs/programs/certification_docs/app_ctc.doc	No Degree Found	“Applicant must have graduated from a four-year course of study at a college of recognized standing. For this requirement, applicant may substitute two years, full-time tax collection experience.”  …  “College education not necessary if qualifying on basis of two years, full-time tax collection experience.”	Although a four-year (bachelor’s) degree is listed, the text explicitly allows applicants to substitute two years of full-time municipal tax collection experience in lieu of that education. Because an alternative non-degree pathway fully replaces the degree requirement, holding a college degree is not mandatory for initial licensure.	0.86	1,161.00

The regulation specifies only a high school diploma (or equivalent) plus other non-degree requirements (age, character, exam, business location).

"A person who received a diploma from a college of medicine in this State ... shall be required as a condition of relicensure by the board..."	The statute discusses physicians’ licensure and repeatedly references holding a diploma from a college of medicine (i.e., graduation from medical school) as the baseline qualification for those seeking (re)licensure. Graduation from medical school is a professional-level degree (MD/DO), so the text explicitly indicates a Graduate/Professional degree is required.	0.65	1,133.00
Occupational Therapy Assistant License	https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/Statutes/occupational-therapy-law.pdf	No Degree Found	"Present evidence to the director of having successfully completed the academic requirements of an educational program in occupational therapy approved by the director..." (45:9-37.62(c)) — no associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree is mentioned anywhere in the licensure requirements for an occupational therapy assistant.	The statute lists completion of an approved occupational therapy educational program and fieldwork but never states that an associate’s, bachelor’s, or higher degree is required, nor does it describe the program in terms that imply a specific college-degree level.	0.87	1,128.00

The statute ties eligibility for a medical license to having attended (and, by context, completed) an approved medical school, which is a post-baccalaureate professional program leading to an MD/DO; this satisfies the definition of a graduate/professional degree requirement.	0.6	1,110.00
Medical Licence	https://www.jeffersonhealth.org/about-us/academic-programs/graduate-medical-education	Explicit Graduate/Professional	“An eligible candidate for residency must be a graduate of a medical school approved by the Pennsylvania State Board of Medicine or the New Jersey State Board of Medicine.”	The text explicitly states that eligibility requires graduation from a medical school, which is a post-baccalaureate professional degree (MD/DO), satisfying the Explicit Graduate/Professional category.	0.83	1,101.00

The text ties eligibility for the alternative licensing examination to individuals who have completed (graduated from) an osteopathic medical school, which is a post-baccalaureate professional program conferring the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree; this constitutes an explicit graduate/professional education requirement.	0.65	1,084.00
Medical Licence	https://regulations.justia.com/states/new-jersey/title-13/chapter-35/subchapter-3/section-13-35-3-12/	No Degree Found	"prior to having commenced medical school studies, he or she has successfully completed a satisfactory course of at least two years ... during which period he or she shall have earned at least 60 credits" – no mention of an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree is made anywhere in the excerpt.	The text only specifies completion of two years/60 credits of college-level coursework as a prerequisite; it never states that the applicant must hold an associate’s, bachelor’s, or higher degree, so no degree requirement can be inferred from this excerpt.	0.75	1,061.00
Medical Licence	https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2018/title-45/chapter-9/section-45-9-8.1/	No Degree Found	"having matriculated at a legally chartered medical college... and having attended four full courses of lectures in said medical college over a period of four years" – the statute speaks only of matriculation and attendance, not of earning any particular degree.	The text lists educational steps (matriculation and course attendance) but never states that the applicant must graduate or possess a specific associate’s, bachelor’s, or medical degree; therefore no explicit or implicit degree requirement is identified.	0.55	1,052.00

Medical Licence	https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2018/title-45/chapter-9/section-45-9-6/	No Degree Found	The only educational reference is: "He shall also present to the board a certificate ... showing that, before entering a professional school or college, he had obtained an academic education consisting of a 4 years' course of study in an approved public or private high school or the equivalent thereof." No associate, bachelor’s, or graduate/professional degree is specified.	The statute excerpt mentions only a high-school level requirement and is silent about any college, bachelor’s, or medical degree; therefore, based on the provided text alone, no college degree requirement can be identified.	0.83	1,029.00
Medical Licence	https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2018/title-45/chapter-9/section-45-9-5/	No Degree Found	The section merely states the register shall note "the time he has spent in obtaining a competent academic and professional education as hereinafter provided, and the names and location of all professional schools or colleges" but provides no explicit or implicit mandate for a specific degree level for licensure.	The provided statute excerpt deals with administrative records and does not set any explicit or implicit educational prerequisite (associate, bachelor’s, or professional degree) for obtaining a medical license.	0.86	1,019.00

Graduate from a medical school outside of the United States or Canada.”  /  “Provide certain documentation related to your medical education credentials, including: … your medical diploma.”	The text expressly states that applicants must graduate from a medical school and submit a medical diploma, which constitutes a professional (MD) degree requirement for initial licensure.	0.9	1,018.00

The statute mandates completion of a two-year, 60-credit collegiate course before entering professional medical study. This mirrors the length and credit load of an associate-level program, implying an associate-level educational requirement even though no specific degree title is mentioned.	0.7	1,016.00
Notary Public	https://nj.gov/treasury/news/2022/06132022.shtml	No Degree Found	The SourceText states only that "applicants for initial notary commissions ... must complete a six-hour course and pass an examination"; it contains no mention of any associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate/professional degree requirement.	The text specifies a short training course and exam as the sole educational components for licensure, with no reference to college degrees at any level, so the minimum degree requirement is none.	0.9	1,127.00
Medical Licence	https://www.njha.com/media/473652/EDU-1782A-PPT-Roeder.pdf	Explicit Graduate/Professional	“Graduation from a Medical School accredited by LCME, AOA or listed in FAIMER.”	The text clearly states that an applicant must have graduated from an accredited medical school, which confers the MD or DO professional degree—an explicit graduate/professional requirement.	0.9	1,005.00
Medical Licence	https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2018/title-45/chapter-9/section-45-9-13/	No Degree Found	The section only describes reciprocity for applicants already "examined and licensed by the examining and licensing board of another State" or by national boards and says they must meet "the requirements demanded in the other sections"; it nowhere specifies any college, medical school, or other degree requirement.	Within the provided statute excerpt there is no explicit or implicit statement that a medical, bachelor’s, or associate’s degree is required; the text addresses licensure by endorsement and defers academic standards to other sections not included here.	0.85	985

The text plainly requires completion of an MD or DO—professional doctoral degrees—before a New Jersey medical license can be issued, making the requirement explicitly graduate/professional level.	0.95	978
Medical Licence	https://regulations.justia.com/states/new-jersey/title-13/chapter-35/subchapter-3/section-13-35-3-2/	No Degree Found	The provided section discusses reciprocity and states only that the issuing state must have had "education, training, and examination requirements for licensure substantially equivalent to the current Board standards," without specifying any requirement for an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate/professional degree.	The SourceText contains no explicit or implicit reference to a specific degree (MD, DO, bachelor’s, etc.) as a prerequisite for initial licensure; it merely references equivalency of prior requirements, so no degree requirement can be determined from this text.	0.88	976
Medical Licence	https://regulations.justia.com/states/new-jersey/title-13/chapter-35/subchapter-3/section-13-35-3-15/	No Degree Found	No explicit mention of any associate, bachelor’s, or graduate/professional degree requirement appears; the text only states, "Postgraduate training shall be taken under the auspices of a hospital … accredited … by the ACGME, AOA, or APMA."	The regulation excerpt discusses required postgraduate training locations but does not specify that an applicant must hold any particular degree (MD, DO, bachelor’s, etc.). Therefore, based solely on the provided text, no college degree requirement is identified.	0.85	971
Medical Licence	https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2018/title-45/chapter-9/section-45-9-14.1/	No Degree Found	The statute lists prerequisites such as "completed an interneship acceptable to the board for a period of two years" or "has completed a post-graduate course of two years acceptable to the board" but nowhere mentions the need for a bachelor’s, associate’s, or graduate/professional degree.	The provided section specifies internships, residency, and examination requirements but contains no language requiring any academic degree; therefore, no college-level degree requirement can be inferred from this text.	0.88	966

The statute excerpt discusses cultural competency training for licensure but contains no language specifying that applicants must hold a medical, graduate, bachelor’s, or associate’s degree. Therefore, based solely on the provided text, no degree requirement can be identified.	0.87	950
Medical Licence	https://nj.gov/highereducation/documents/pdf/AGMEC/BME_regulations.pdf	No Degree Found	The regulation describes student eligibility (e.g., "Preparedness of each student ... demonstrated by achievement of ... a passing grade on Part I of the National Board of Medical Examiners Examination"), program approval, and oversight of clinical clerkships, but nowhere in the text is a requirement stated that an applicant for a medical license must hold an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate/professional degree.	The provided subchapter governs approval of clinical training programs for medical students; it lists exam scores and program supervision criteria but never specifies any degree (MD, bachelor’s, etc.) that an individual must possess for initial licensure, so no degree requirement can be inferred from this text.	0.87	936
Medical Licence	https://www.nj.gov/highereducation/documents/pdf/AGMEC/BME_regulations.pdf	No Degree Found	No section of the provided text specifies any educational degree (Associate’s, Bachelor’s, or Graduate/Professional) as a prerequisite for obtaining an initial medical license; the rules instead address standards for clinical clerkship programs for medical students.	The regulation only governs approval and operation of clinical training programs sponsored by certain foreign medical schools. It sets criteria for student participation in those programs but never states what degree must be held to qualify for initial physician licensure in New Jersey.	0.9	928
Medical Licence	https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/bme/Pages/continuingeducation.aspx	Could Not Determine	The text focuses on cultural competency training in medical schools and CME for already "licensed physicians" but nowhere states that graduation from medical school (or any other degree) is a prerequisite for initial licensure.	While medical school diplomas are mentioned, the passage addresses curricular and continuing education requirements, not the educational criteria for obtaining the initial medical license, leaving the actual degree prerequisite unclear.	0.35	897
Medical Licence	https://regulations.justia.com/states/new-jersey/title-13/chapter-35/subchapter-2b/section-13-35-2b-19/	No Degree Found	The section references completion of an "education program for physician assistants that is approved by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant, Inc. (ARC-PA)" but nowhere specifies that the program must confer an associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, or other academic degree.	The provided regulation discusses accepting military training/education and refers generally to an approved PA program, yet it never states that a particular college degree (associate, bachelor’s, graduate) is required for initial licensure. Therefore, no degree requirement can be inferred from this text alone.	0.83	877
Medical Licence	https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2018/title-45/chapter-9/section-45-9-1/	No Degree Found	The provided statute section only addresses the composition of the State Board of Medical Examiners (e.g., requiring some board members to be "graduates of schools of medicine or osteopathic medicine"), but nowhere states what educational credential an applicant must hold to obtain an initial medical license.	The excerpt discusses qualifications for board membership, not the qualifications an applicant must meet for initial licensure as a physician, so no educational requirement for licensure can be identified from this text.	0.78	876

The SourceText focuses exclusively on continuing education in cultural competency for already-licensed physicians and podiatrists; it never sets out the educational credential (e.g., MD, DO, or any college degree) needed for first-time licensure, so no degree requirement can be identified from this text.	0.86	868

The statute only defines when a physician may be called "homeopathic," listing graduation from a homeopathic medical college as just one of several alternative qualifications. It does not set out the full educational prerequisites for obtaining a medical license in New Jersey, so the minimum degree requirement for licensure cannot be determined from this text alone.	0.4	844

The text never states any degree requirement for obtaining the ABMDI certification itself.	The source lists educational requirements for the job but only references the ABMDI certification as a separate credential without specifying any degree prerequisite for that certification, so no degree requirement can be inferred for the license.	0.86	849
Medicolegal Death Investigator Certification	https://info.csc.state.nj.us/jobannouncements/DefaultJobAnnouncement/ViewCompetitiveJobDescription?guid=38239	No Degree Found	"Possession of a valid registry basic certification issued by the American Board of Medicolegal Death Investigators (ABMDI) may be substituted for the Bachelor’s degree."; "Appointees must possess a valid registry basic certification from the American Board of Medicolegal Death Investigators (ABMDI)."

Because the text never specifies a degree as a prerequisite—only mentioning the subject’s own academic history—the rules classify this as having no degree requirement found.	0.9	743

Occupational Therapist License	https://www.duny.edu/ot/9814-2/	Could Not Determine	The SourceText only presents a “Curriculum Sequence for Graduate Occupational Therapy Students” with lists of courses and credits; it never states that graduation from this or any degree program is required for initial licensure as an occupational therapist in New Jersey.	Because the excerpt merely outlines a university’s graduate‐level course sequence without tying completion of that program (or any specific degree) to the state licensing requirements, the minimum degree requirement for licensure cannot be determined from this text alone.	0.3	811

Pilot Licence	https://centuryair.com/flight-training/frequently-asked-questions/	No Degree Found	“Contrary to popular belief, it is not necessary to go to an aviation university to become a career pilot.”	The provided text explicitly states that attending an aviation university (or obtaining any specific college degree) is not necessary to become a pilot, and no other degree requirement is mentioned.	0.85	853
Pilot Licence	https://rhombus-cod-mjdl.squarespace.com/s/2018-annual-report-draft.pdf	No Degree Found	The SourceText describes licensure through apprenticeships and examinations (e.g., “After serving a five-year apprenticeship he sat for his state licensing exam…”, “The Commission… selects qualified Maritime Pilot apprentices and Docking Pilot apprentices; … Grants state pilot licenses”) but nowhere specifies that a college (associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate) degree is required for initial licensure.	All references to becoming a pilot involve apprenticeship periods and state exams; the document never states any mandate for an associate’s, bachelor’s, or higher degree, so the minimum educational requirement cannot be a college degree based on the provided text.	0.88	791
Nursing Home Administrator License	https://www.nj.gov/health/healthfacilities/certification-licensing/nursing-home-adm/	No Degree Found	The listed application materials include “an official college transcript,” but the text never states that a bachelor’s, associate’s, or graduate degree is required. All other requirements refer to fees, forms, an Administrative Intern Program, a 100-hour course, and ethics CE, with no mention of any specific degree.	The source outlines multiple steps and documents but never explicitly or implicitly sets a minimum academic degree; therefore, under the hierarchy, the correct classification is that no degree requirement was found.	0.83	1,102.00
Plant Engineer License	https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/Statutes/professional-engineers-land-surveyors-law.pdf	Explicit Bachelor's	"As a professional engineer: a. Graduation from a board approved curriculum in engineering of four years or more; ... and successfully passing all parts of the written examination" (N.J.S.A. 45:8-35).	Licensure (which would cover a Plant Engineer practicing professional engineering) expressly demands completion of a four-year engineering curriculum, equivalent to a bachelor’s degree, before experience and examinations; therefore a bachelor’s degree level education is explicitly required.	0.9	999
Plant Engineer License	https://www.sru.edu/documents/academics/online-learning/Engineer%20Licensing%20Requirements%20by%20State.pdf	Could Not Determine	The source text lists degree requirements for 'professional engineer' licensure (e.g., “Graduation from a board approved curriculum in engineering of four years or more”), but it never references a 'Plant Engineer License' or its specific educational prerequisites.	Because the text provides no information about a distinct 'Plant Engineer License', I cannot reliably determine whether that particular license requires a college degree.	0.3	944
Psychology Licence	https://www.nj.gov/education/certification/edsrvs/endorsementsedsrvs/3100S.shtml	Explicit Graduate/Professional	"Hold a master’s or higher degree from an accredited college or university." ; "Complete a New Jersey Department of Education (NJDOE)-approved graduate program in school psychology."	For the School Psychologist standard certificate—the primary license described—all eligibility options explicitly require completion of a graduate-level program or possession of at least a master’s degree, so the minimum degree is clearly at the graduate/professional level.	0.9	1,102.00
Notary Public	https://www.middlesexcountynj.gov/government/departments/department-of-community-services/office-of-county-clerk/notary-services/notary-frequently-asked-questions	No Degree Found	Eligibility: "A resident who is 18 years of age or older." Training: "Non-attorney applicants for initial notary public commissions must provide proof that they have: Completed a six-hour course of study approved by the State Treasurer and passed an examination." No mention of any associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree requirement.	The text lists age, residency, a six-hour course, and an exam as the only educational/training requirements; it never references any college degree. Therefore, the license does not require a degree based on the provided source.	0.9	1,101.00
Professional Engineer	https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-jersey/N-J-A-C-13-40-2-2	Explicit Bachelor's	“Shall demonstrate graduation from a program with a bachelor's degree in engineering … or graduation from a program with a bachelor's degree in engineering technology …”	The rule plainly mandates possession of a bachelor’s degree in engineering or engineering technology from an ABET-accredited program for initial licensure, leaving no alternative pathway that eliminates the degree requirement.	0.9	1,205.00
Professional Engineer	https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/title-45/section-45-8-35/	Implicit Bachelor's	"Graduation from a board approved curriculum in engineering of four years or more;"  and  "Graduation from a board approved curriculum in engineering technology of four years or more;"	All listed pathways to become a licensed Professional Engineer require completion of a board-approved 4-year engineering or engineering-technology curriculum. A 4-year program is generally understood to be at the bachelor’s level, even though the statute does not use the word "bachelor’s," making the requirement an implicit bachelor’s degree.	0.85	1,195.00
Professional Planner	https://www.morriscountynj.gov/Jobs/Planner-Trainee-Office-of-Planning-and-Preservation?oc_lang=it	Could Not Determine	The text only states: "possession of a current and valid license as a professional planner in New Jersey, issued by the New Jersey Board of Professional Planners, may substitute for the education requirement" but provides no description of what education is required to obtain that license.	The source text is a job posting that references the existence of the Professional Planner license but does not specify any educational prerequisites for obtaining that license, so a definitive determination cannot be made.	0.3	1,100.00
Professional Planner	https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/plan/Pages/FAQ.aspx	No Degree Found	“An upgrade form demonstrating the required work experience; or Transcripts verifying that the planner-in-training has completed the required educational experience.” / “An applicant for licensure as a professional planner shall obtain a passing grade on both the national and State parts of the professional planner's examination.”  No statement says a specific college degree is mandatory for the Professional Planner license, and an experience-only path is expressly allowed.	The text lists exam and upgrade/experience pathways but never states that a bachelor’s, associate’s, or graduate degree is a required condition for obtaining the Professional Planner license; experience alone can satisfy the qualification, so no degree requirement is established.	0.82	1,099.00
Certified Nurse Aide	https://nj.gov/health/healthfacilities/documents/rfpappendixes/appendix_b.pdf	No Degree Found	§ 8:39-43.2(a)1: "Successfully complete a nurse aide in long-term care facilities training program that has been approved by the Department;"  § 8:39-43.10(b): "An approved training program for nurse aides shall consist of 90 hours of training..."  (No mention anywhere of Associate's, Bachelor's, or higher degree requirements.)	The regulations specify completion of a short state-approved training program and passing competency exams but contain no reference to any college degree. Therefore, initial certification does not require an Associate’s, Bachelor’s, or Graduate/Professional degree.	0.9	1,098.00
Pilot Licence	https://www.nj.gov/transportation/maritimepilot/pdf/Docking_PIlot_Apprentice_Application.doc	No Degree Found	The application instructions list required items such as Coast Guard licenses, physical forms, drug screening, and "written documentation of at least ten years’ experience in the maritime industry" but nowhere mention any Associate’s, Bachelor’s, or higher degree requirement.	The official application sets experience and credential prerequisites but does not specify or imply any college degree; therefore initial licensure does not require a degree based on the provided text.	0.9	1,096.00
Fire Official Certification	https://nj.gov/dca/divisions/dfs/forms/bfds/2021%20Ed%20Forms/fifo_application_2021.pdf	No Degree Found	"The educational program requirements to obtain certification as a Fire Inspector or Fire Official are specified pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:71-4.9 ... and must be the adopted programs approved through the Office of Training and Certification."  "To obtain a Fire Official certification, in addition to meeting the credentialing requirements of Fire Inspector, the State adopted Fire Official program of instruction must be completed."	The text lists only completion of specific state-approved instructional programs and passing exams as prerequisites; it never requires or implies any college degree level.	0.88	1,095.00
Professional Engineer	https://www.greenbaumlaw.com/media/publication/473_Construction_Laws_and_Customs_New_Jersey-_28w-001-3178_29.pdf	Explicit Bachelor's	"An applicant for licensure as an engineer must fulfill one of the following sets of requirements: Graduate from a board-approved curriculum in engineering of four years or more..." and "Graduate from a board-approved curriculum in engineering technology of four years or more..." (N.J.S.A. 45:8-35(1)).	The statute defines initial licensure pathways that all begin with graduation from a board-approved 4-year engineering or engineering-technology program, which corresponds to a bachelor’s degree level.	0.9	1,101.00
Instructional Certificate	https://www.nj.gov/education/certification/edsrvs/endorsementsedsrvs/3462CE.shtml	Explicit Bachelor's	“A bachelor’s degree in speech-language pathology/communication disorders from an accredited college or university.”; “A bachelor’s degree in a major other than speech-language pathology/communication disorders from an accredited college or university.”	Both option pathways for the Speech Language Specialist endorsement explicitly state that applicants must already hold a bachelor’s degree; although enrollment in a master’s program is also required, completion of that graduate degree is not, making the bachelor’s the minimum explicit degree requirement.	0.9	1,095.00
Professional Engineer	https://pdh-pro.com/pe-resources/continuing-education-requirements-for-new-jersey-engineers/	Explicit Bachelor's	"First, the candidate must hold a four-year degree from an engineering program that is accredited."

Professional Engineer	https://www.harborcompliance.com/structural-engineer-nj	Explicit Bachelor's	"EAC/ABET-accredited program degree" … "TAC/ABET-accredited program degree" are listed in the Education column as prerequisites for individual licensure.	Requiring a degree from an ABET-accredited engineering (EAC) or engineering technology (TAC/ETAC) program signifies the need for the standard 4-year bachelor’s degree those programs confer, meeting the definition of an explicit bachelor’s requirement.	0.8	1,042.00
Professional Engineer	https://soe.rutgers.edu/student-experience/career-development/professional-licensing	Explicit Bachelor's	“To become licensed, engineers must complete a four-year college degree, work under a Professional Engineer for at least four years, pass two intensive competency exams and earn a license from their state’s licensure board.”	The source explicitly states that obtaining a Professional Engineer license requires completion of a four-year college degree, which corresponds to a bachelor’s level education.	0.86	1,028.00
Professional Engineer	https://njspe.org/2021/08/10/steps-to-receiving-a-pe-license-without-an-engineering-degree/	Explicit Bachelor's	"If you received a bachelor’s degree in a non-engineering field, it may still be possible for you receive your PE license!"; "the next step for receiving a PE license would be to earn a four-year degree in an ABET-accredited engineering program."	The text repeatedly references the need for a bachelor’s (four-year) degree—either an ABET-accredited engineering degree or a non-engineering bachelor’s that is evaluated to meet engineering standards—indicating an explicit bachelor’s-level education requirement for initial licensure.	0.7	997
Professional Engineer	https://ww2.georgiasouthern.edu/academics/adult-learners/home/state-authorizations/licensure/new-jersey/	Explicit Bachelor's	"The minimum requirements for a PE license include completion of a BS degree in Engineering from an EAC-ABET accredited engineering program;"	The text explicitly states that obtaining a Professional Engineer license in New Jersey requires completion of a BS (bachelor's) degree in engineering, clearly satisfying the 'Explicit Bachelor's' criterion.	0.92	997
Professional Engineer	https://pdh-pro.com/new-jersey-professional-engineers-requirements/	Explicit Bachelor's	“Step 1: Earn a 4-year degree from an accredited institute of higher learning.”	The source explicitly lists earning a 4-year degree as the first step toward licensure, which squarely meets the definition of an explicit bachelor’s requirement.	0.9	987
Professional Engineer	https://www.utoledo.edu/offices/internalaudit/institutional-compliance/state-authorization/pld-stateengineerandsurveyorboards.html	Explicit Bachelor's	"Completion of a UToledo-accredited Engineering Science degree meets New Jersey educational requirements to apply for a PE license." ; "The BS in Computer Science & Engineering and the BS in Computer Science & Engineering Technology degree programs are ... accredited by ... ABET"	The text states that meeting New Jersey’s educational requirement for PE licensure is achieved by completing an ABET-accredited Engineering Science (or Technology) degree, and the document identifies these as BS (Bachelor of Science) programs, explicitly indicating a bachelor’s-level education is required.	0.82	979
Professional Engineer	https://ncees.org/exams/pe-exam/	No Degree Found	In the New Jersey section, the text only states that applicants register directly with NCEES and later apply to the Board for licensure; no associate, bachelor’s, or graduate degree requirement is mentioned anywhere in the provided New Jersey PE licensure details.	The source text outlines exam registration and application procedures but never specifies that a PE applicant must hold a bachelor’s (or any) degree, so no college‐degree requirement can be inferred from the material given.	0.83	979
Professional Engineer	https://engineersealstamps.com/blogs/info/new-jersey-pe-seal-requirements-unraveled-your-ultimate-guide	Implicit Bachelor's	“Individuals must graduate from an accredited engineering program or have an equivalent education.”	The text requires graduation from an accredited engineering program—wording that normally refers to a four-year bachelor’s engineering degree—but it never explicitly says “bachelor’s,” so the requirement is inferred rather than stated outright.	0.72	957
Professional Engineer	https://info.csc.nj.gov/jobspec/02794@.htm	No Degree Found	The text only states "Possession of a Professional Engineers (PE) License issued by the New Jersey State Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors may be substituted for the above education requirement." It provides no information on what education is needed to obtain the PE license itself.	The source text does not describe any educational prerequisites for obtaining a Professional Engineer license; it merely references possession of the license without outlining degree requirements for licensure.	0.85	952

Visit the board’s website for licensure application instructions once you have passed the exam." – no educational degree requirement is mentioned anywhere in the New Jersey-specific text.	The New Jersey licensure excerpt outlines exam and application procedures but never references any Associate’s, Bachelor’s, or Graduate degree. Without explicit or implicit degree language, the minimum degree requirement cannot be inferred from this source.	0.86	917

"Possession of a valid Professional Engineer's License issued by the New Jersey State Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors may be substituted for the Bachelor's degree in Engineering."	The text mentions the Professional Engineer license but gives no explicit or implicit educational requirement for obtaining that license; therefore no college degree requirement can be identified from the provided source.	0.85	892
Professional Engineer	https://info.csc.nj.gov/jobspec/02795@.htm	No Degree Found	The text only states that applicants "may substitute possession of a Professional Engineer's License" for the bachelor's-degree requirement of the job; it does not describe any educational prerequisites for obtaining the Professional Engineer license itself.	The provided source discusses job requirements and mentions the PE license as an alternative to a bachelor’s degree but never specifies what education, if any, is required to obtain that license; therefore no degree requirement can be inferred for licensure from this text.	0.85	891
Professional Engineer	https://info.csc.state.nj.us/jobspec/03314.htm	No Degree Found	"Possession of a Professional Engineers (PE) License ... may be substituted for the above education requirement." The text lists a Bachelor's degree for the job title, but provides no educational prerequisite for obtaining the PE license itself.	The SourceText discusses education needed for a Senior Engineer job and merely references an existing PE license as an alternative; it does not specify any degree requirement for earning the Professional Engineer license, so no degree requirement can be identified from the provided text.	0.85	889
Professional Engineer	https://info.csc.nj.gov/jobspec/03314.htm	No Degree Found	The text lists a Bachelor’s degree as a job requirement but only says: "Possession of a Professional Engineers (PE) License ... may be substituted for the above education requirement." It provides no educational prerequisites for obtaining the PE license itself.	The source material discusses job qualifications and notes that having a PE license can replace the job’s degree requirement, but it never states what degree (if any) is required to earn the Professional Engineer license, so no degree requirement for initial licensure can be identified.	0.75	835

(7:26I-6.4) – the only passage mentioning Professional Engineer licensure contains no educational prerequisites.	The excerpt addresses Licensed Site Remediation Professionals; Professional Engineer licensure is only referenced in passing without specifying any degree requirement, so no collegiate degree requirement can be determined from this text.	0.9	828
Professional Engineer	https://engineerboards.com/threads/pe-requirements-in-new-jersey.3652/reply?quote=6582830	No Degree Found	The provided text only discusses length of experience ("four years" or "three years, if have an MS degree") and supervision by a PE; it contains no statement that any Associate’s, Bachelor’s, or Graduate degree is required for initial licensure.	The excerpt focuses solely on experience under a PE and briefly notes an optional reduction if an applicant holds an MS. It never states that any college degree—associate, bachelor’s, or graduate—is mandatory, so no degree requirement can be inferred from this text.	0.87	790

No sentence states that any associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree is mandatory—only that a master’s can reduce the experience time.	The discussion lists only experience and supervision requirements and notes a master’s degree merely shortens the experience period, implying a degree is optional rather than required; no explicit or implicit mandate for any college degree appears in the text.	0.85	785
Professional Engineer	https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/arch/Pages/faq.aspx	No Degree Found	The source text outlines educational requirements for architects but does not list any educational prerequisites for initial licensure as a Professional Engineer.

Because the text only covers graduate program admission and not the initial licensure requirements for a Professional Nurse, there is no information specifying any associate, bachelor’s, or graduate degree requirement for obtaining the license.	0.85	950
Professional Nurse	https://pccc.edu/nursing/program-requirements-day-evening-option/	Implicit Associate's	"Total Credits for Degree 68"; four-semester sequence presented as the complete "Program Requirements" for the nursing degree.	The source outlines a 68-credit, two-year nursing program culminating in a degree, which matches the credit load of an associate-level RN program even though the word "associate" is not explicitly used.	0.65	943
Professional Nurse	https://www.wpunj.edu/cosh/departments/nursing/graduate-programs/nursingfamilynurse.html	Explicit Bachelor's	"A bachelor's degree (BSN) from an accredited college or university"	The source explicitly lists possession of a BSN as an admission prerequisite, establishing that at least a bachelor’s degree is required before pursuing this professional nursing pathway.	0.74	916
Professional Nurse	https://nursing.rutgers.edu/nursing-licensure-requirements/	Could Not Determine	"Licensure requires successful degree completion and passing of the NCLEX exam."	The text indicates that some unspecified "degree" must be completed for licensure but provides no detail on whether this is an associate, bachelor's, or higher degree, leaving the exact level indeterminate.	0.3	911
Professional Nurse	https://berkeleycollege.edu/catalogs/undergraduate-2024-2025/academics-programs/nursing/nursing-lpn-to-bsn/index.html	Could Not Determine	“Berkeley College’s LPN to BSN program meets the educational requirements for licensure in the state of New Jersey… Graduates are awarded a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree and are eligible to participate in the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN).”	The text indicates that completion of a BSN-granting program satisfies New Jersey’s licensure education requirement, but it never states that a BSN (or any specific degree level) is the minimum mandatory credential for all applicants. Because other pathways are not addressed, the minimum degree requirement for licensure cannot be conclusively determined from this source alone.	0.4	901
Professional Nurse	https://pccc.edu/nursing/lpn/	No Degree Found	"An applicant for admission to the Nurse Education LPN Mobility Program must be a high school graduate or have a high school equivalency diploma (GED)..." – No mention of needing an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree anywhere in the listed requirements.	The only educational prerequisite specified is a high school diploma or GED; there is no explicit or implicit requirement for any college degree, so the minimum degree requirement cannot be inferred beyond high-school level.	0.86	897
Professional Nurse	https://www.monmouth.edu/graduate/application-requirements/	No Degree Found	The SourceText outlines various graduate program admission criteria but nowhere specifies the educational prerequisites for obtaining a New Jersey Professional Nurse (RN) license.	The excerpt focuses on university graduate admissions and only mentions holding an RN license as an admission prerequisite for advanced nursing degrees; it does not state what degree, if any, is required to obtain the initial Professional Nurse license itself.	0.86	893
Professional Nurse	https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/nur/Documents/Nursing-Programs/Baccalaureate-Degree-Nursing-Programs.pdf	Could Not Determine	The provided excerpt simply lists “BACCALAUREATE SCHOOLS” followed by school names and addresses; it contains no language stating that graduation from one of these programs (or any degree level) is required for licensure.	Because the text offers only a directory of baccalaureate nursing programs without any statement tying completion of such a program to initial licensure, it is impossible to conclude from this excerpt alone whether a degree (and at what level) is required.	0.25	885
Professional Nurse	https://www.wpunj.edu/cosh/departments/nursing/	Explicit Bachelor's	"The BSN prepares students for entry-level practice as a professional nurse... BSN graduates are eligible to take the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN)..."	The only path presented for eligibility to sit for the licensing exam and enter practice as a professional nurse is completion of a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN); this explicitly ties a bachelor's degree to initial licensure eligibility.	0.73	880
Professional Nurse	https://www.wpunj.edu/cosh/departments/nursing/undergraduate-program/	Explicit Bachelor's	“Graduates of this program are awarded a bachelor of science degree with a major in nursing. Upon completion of the program, graduates are eligible to take the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN).”	The text directly links completion of a Bachelor of Science in Nursing program to eligibility for the licensure exam for professional nurses, indicating an explicit requirement of a bachelor’s degree for initial licensure based on the information provided.	0.8	864
Professional Nurse	https://www.wpunj.edu/cosh/departments/nursing/graduate-programs/nursingadultgerontology.html	No Degree Found	The source text describes admission criteria for a graduate nursing program but provides no statement about the educational prerequisites for obtaining a New Jersey Professional Nurse license.	The excerpt is limited to program admission and certification information for a Nurse Practitioner track; it never sets out the education required to become licensed as a Professional Nurse, so no college-degree requirement can be concluded for that license from this text.	0.86	860
Professional Nurse	https://pccc.edu/nursing/program-requirements-lpn-mobility-option/	Implicit Associate's	"This option is designed for LPNs who desire careers as registered nurses."; "Total Credits for Degree 70"	The curriculum outlines a 70-credit, four-semester program typical of an associate-degree nursing pathway leading to RN licensure, but the text never explicitly states "associate’s degree," so the requirement is inferred rather than stated outright.	0.65	857
Professional Nurse	https://www.wpunj.edu/cosh/departments/nursing/graduate-programs/	No Degree Found	The text discusses admission to a Master of Science in Nursing program (e.g., “A BSN transcript with a minimum of 3.0 GPA is required”) but gives no information about the educational prerequisites for obtaining an initial Professional Nurse (RN) license itself.	Because the SourceText focuses solely on graduate-level program admissions and only notes that applicants already possess an RN license, it provides no explicit or implicit degree requirement for earning the Professional Nurse license; therefore, no degree requirement can be concluded for licensure from this text.	0.85	853
Professional Nurse	https://www.wpunj.edu/cosh/departments/nursing/undergraduate-program/accelerated-second-degree/	Could Not Determine	"The ABSN (Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing) program is for individuals who already possess a baccalaureate degree in any discipline." / "Students with an Associates Degree are not eligible for the ABSN program. They may apply to the Undergraduate nursing program at WP."	The passages only describe admission criteria for William Paterson University’s accelerated BSN program, not the statutory or regulatory educational requirements for initial licensure as a Professional Nurse in New Jersey; therefore the minimum degree needed for licensure cannot be determined from this text alone.	0.4	837
Professional Nurse	https://nursejournal.org/state/new-jersey/msn-programs/	Could Not Determine	All educational references relate to eligibility for graduate MSN programs, e.g., “Degree requirements: … RN license, BSN” (Seton Hall University) and similar lists for other schools, but the text never states what educational level is required to obtain the initial Professional Nurse (RN) license itself.	The provided article discusses admission prerequisites for RN-to-MSN programs, not the statutory or regulatory requirements for first-time RN licensure in New Jersey, so the minimum degree needed for that license cannot be ascertained from this source.	0.35	818
Professional Nurse	https://nursing.rutgers.edu/academics-admissions/graduate/dnp/anesthesia/admissions/	No Degree Found	“To be licensed in most states, a criminal history background check is a prerequisite for licensure as a registered professional nurse (RN)….”  – no educational degree requirement for licensure is stated anywhere in the text.	The source text discusses admissions to a nurse-anesthesia graduate program and notes only a background-check requirement for RN licensure; it never specifies that an associate’s, bachelor’s, or higher degree is required to obtain the Professional Nurse license itself.	0.86	814
Professional Nurse	https://www.wpunj.edu/cosh/departments/nursing/graduate-programs/school-nurse-certificate-programs.html	Could Not Determine	The text discusses admission to a School Nurse Certification program, stating a "Bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university" is needed along with a "Current NJ RN License," but it never lists the educational prerequisites for obtaining that RN/Professional Nurse license itself.	All degree language relates to entry into a separate school-nurse certification program, not to the initial licensure requirements for a Professional Nurse; therefore the source does not allow a clear determination of the degree needed for that license.	0.3	810
Professional Nurse	https://catalog.njcu.edu/graduate/professional-studies/nursing/school-nursing-graduate-certificate/school-nursing-graduate-certificate.pdf	Could Not Determine	The text lists admission criteria for a graduate School Nurse Certificate (e.g., “BSN from an institution…”, “Copy of current, unencumbered NJ nursing license”) but never states what educational credential is required to obtain the NJ professional nurse (RN) license itself.	All degree references relate to entry into a post-licensure school-nurse certificate program, not to the initial professional nurse licensure requirements, which are not provided in the excerpt.	0.4	809
Professional Nurse	https://www.wpunj.edu/cosh/departments/nursing/doctor-of-nursing-practice/	No Degree Found	The SourceText only outlines admissions criteria for a post-master’s Doctor of Nursing Practice program and notes accreditation of various nursing degree programs; it never states any educational prerequisite for obtaining a New Jersey Professional Nurse (RN) license.	Because the text describes academic programs rather than licensure rules, it contains no explicit or implicit requirement for an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree to secure initial Professional Nurse licensure.	0.9	806
Professional Nurse	https://www.wpunj.edu/cosh/departments/nursing/undergraduate-program/generic-program/	Could Not Determine	The SourceText only describes a specific university’s 4-year Bachelor of Science in Nursing program and never states that this (or any) degree is mandated by the State for Professional Nurse licensure.	Because the passage is purely informational about one BSN program and contains no regulatory or licensing language, it is impossible to ascertain the minimum education the State requires for initial licensure as a Professional Nurse.	0.35	800
Professional Nurse	https://www.wpunj.edu/cosh/departments/nursing/graduate-programs/post-masters-adult-nurse-practitioner-certification-program.html	No Degree Found	The provided text lists admission requirements for a post-master’s certificate program but gives no information on the educational prerequisites for obtaining the initial Professional Nurse (RN) license itself.	The source discusses a post-licensure academic program and requires applicants to already hold an RN license; it never states what degree (if any) is needed to obtain that RN license, so no licensure degree requirement can be inferred from the text.	0.83	782
Professional Nurse	https://catalog.njcu.edu/graduate/professional-studies/nursing/school-nursing-graduate-certificate/	Could Not Determine	The text only lists admission criteria for a graduate School Nurse Certificate (e.g., "BSN from an institution..." and "Copy of current, unencumbered NJ nursing license") but gives no details on what education is required to obtain the Professional Nurse license itself.	Because the excerpt deals exclusively with a post-licensure certificate program and never outlines the educational prerequisites for initial Professional Nurse licensure, the required degree level for that license cannot be determined from this source.	0.25	773
Professional Nurse	https://www.kean.edu/academics/nursing/school-nursing-certificate	Could Not Determine	The only reference to licensure is "Proof of valid NJ RN license"; the text gives no information about what education is required to obtain that RN (Professional Nurse) license itself.	The SourceText addresses admission to a school-nursing graduate certificate and does not describe the educational prerequisites for initial Professional Nurse licensure, so the degree requirement cannot be determined from the supplied information.	0.3	758
Stationary Engineer License	https://www.nj.gov/labor/safetyandhealth/resources-support/laws-regulations/boileract.shtml	No Degree Found	"To be eligible for a third grade steam engineer's (1-C or 8-C) examination, the applicant shall have a boiler operator in-charge high pressure license and shall have had at least six months subsequent experience…" (12:90-8.7) ; "To be eligible for a second grade engineer's examination, the applicant shall have a third grade license and shall have had at least one year's subsequent practical experience…" (12:90-8.11).  No section references any Associate's, Bachelor's, or higher degree requirement.	All eligibility provisions for stationary (steam) engineer licenses list prior licenses, practical experience, or specific training periods but never mention a college degree; therefore no degree is required for initial licensure.	0.9	1,083.00
Professional Planner	https://nj.gov/dobi/proposed/ad171120.pdf	No Degree Found	The excerpt notes that N.J.A.C. 13:41 'address[es] requirements for licensure and planner-in-training certification' but the text provided contains no explicit or implicit reference to any associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree requirement.	Within the supplied passage, there is no mention of any college-level degree being required for initial licensure as a Professional Planner; therefore, based solely on this text, no degree requirement can be identified.	0.83	1,082.00
Professional Planner	https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-jersey/N-J-A-C-13-41-5-3	No Degree Found	"iii. Graduation from a secondary school and at least eight years of professional planning experience;"	Because applicants may qualify with only a secondary school education plus experience, a college degree is not mandatory for initial licensure; therefore no degree requirement exists.	0.9	1,222.00
Emergency Medical Technician Certification	https://www.morriscountynj.gov/Jobs/Emergency-Medical-Technician-EMT-Paramedic?oc_lang=ko	No Degree Found	“911 응급구조대 대응 경험 , 고등학교 졸업 또는 동등 학력… 뉴저지 보건부에서 발급한 현재 응급 의료 기술자(EMT) 자격증…” – the text lists only a high school diploma (or equivalent) and possession of an EMT certificate; no associate’s, bachelor’s, or higher degree is mentioned.	The source outlines high-school-level education and certification requirements but never references any college degree, implying that no college degree is required for initial EMT certification.	0.9	1,081.00
Professional Planner	https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-jersey/N-J-A-C-13-41-5-3A	No Degree Found	The provided section only discusses accepting "education, training, or experience" (including military) that is "substantially equivalent" without specifying any Associate’s, Bachelor’s, or Graduate/Professional degree requirement.	The text outlines how military education/training can count toward licensure but never states that a college degree of any level is required; thus, within the given excerpt, no degree requirement is established.	0.86	1,174.00
Inspector License	https://mycareer.nj.gov/training/49666	No Degree Found	"Prerequisites: High School Diploma or GED (accepted from any institution worldwide)." No mention of Associate's, Bachelor's, or higher degrees elsewhere in the licensing description.	The source text states that only a high school diploma or GED is required before entering the training needed for the New Jersey Home Inspector license; no college degree is referenced or implied.	0.9	1,080.00
Interpreter Certification	https://www.nj.gov/education/certification/edsrvs/	Implicit Bachelor's	"To be eligible for a certificate, you must hold the appropriate degree..." ; "Degree Requirements All credits and degrees must appear on an accredited four-year college or university transcript."	Applicants must possess a degree whose credits are recorded on a four-year college/university transcript; this implicitly points to completion of at least a bachelor-level program even though the word “bachelor’s” is not used.	0.62	1,080.00
Actuarial License	https://mycareer.nj.gov/occupation/15-2011	Explicit Bachelor's	“Actuaries need a bachelor’s degree and must pass a series of exams to become certified professionals.”	The text directly states that actuaries need a bachelor’s degree, clearly satisfying the criterion for an explicit bachelor’s requirement.	0.9	1,079.00
Agricultural Inspection Licence	https://info.csc.nj.gov/jobspec/02473.htm	Explicit Bachelor's	“Graduation from an accredited college with a Bachelor's degree in Biology, Entomology, or other Plant Science.”	The source explicitly states that graduation with a Bachelor’s degree is required, satisfying the criteria for an Explicit Bachelor’s degree requirement.	0.9	1,079.00
Barber License	https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/cos/Applications/Out-of-Country-Professional-License-and-Training-Evaluation-Instructions.pdf	No Degree Found	The instructions discuss completing required coursework/hours at a cosmetology school and credential evaluations, but nowhere mention needing an Associate’s, Bachelor’s, or any college degree for a Barber license.	The provided Board instructions specify training hours and course equivalency as the basis for licensure; no academic degree is referenced, indicating that a college degree is not required for initial licensure.	0.9	1,079.00
Inspector License	https://www.nj.gov/dca/codes/official/	No Degree Found	The provided text states only that "Applicants meeting the education, testing and experience requirements... may obtain a license," but it never specifies an Associate’s, Bachelor’s, Graduate, or any college degree.	The excerpt outlines that some unspecified education is required but gives no indication that a college degree (of any level) is mandatory; therefore, no degree requirement can be inferred from the text.	0.85	1,078.00
Tax Collector Certificate	https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/dlgs/resources/rules_docs/5_32/NJAC%205_32-3.pdf	No Degree Found	No degree requirement (associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate) is mentioned anywhere in the listed prerequisites; the text only requires completion of specified courses and passing an examination.	The regulation outlines course completion and exam requirements for certification but never references or mandates any college degree, indicating that no degree is required for initial licensure.	0.86	1,078.00
Professional Nurse	https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/nur/Documents/Nursing-Programs/Information-for-Registered-Professional-Nursing-Programs.pdf	No Degree Found	The provided text sets curriculum standards for nursing education programs but never states that licensure requires an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree; no degree terminology appears in relation to initial licensure.	Because the excerpt discusses course content, program length, and other curricular matters without specifying any academic degree as a prerequisite, it contains no degree requirement for initial licensure.	0.86	1,076.00
Court Interpreter Certification	https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/10294_oralexam_appl.pdf	No Degree Found	“First-time candidates must: A.

Fill out and mail in an application….”  |  “Eligibility… Only candidates from New Jersey and neighboring states are eligible to test in New Jersey.”  |  “Persons are eligible to enter the program if they reside in or near enough to New Jersey….”  (No mention of any associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree in these eligibility requirements.)	The source lays out the steps to qualify (written exam, orientation, oral exam, residency) but never requires completion of any college degree; educational references are optional suggestions or apply only to repeat-testers, not to initial licensure.	0.9	1,075.00
Instructional Certificate	https://www.nj.gov/education/certification/edsrvs/endorsementsedsrvs/3461S.shtml	Explicit Bachelor's	“Degree Requirement  Hold a bachelor’s or higher degree from an accredited college or university.”	The text clearly states that to obtain the initial Certificate of Eligibility (the first step toward this endorsement), the applicant must possess at least a bachelor’s degree. This is an explicit bachelor’s‐level requirement.	0.95	1,075.00
Professional Planner	https://www.nj.gov/transportation/careers/pdf/jobpostings/Job_Post_24-00346.pdf	No Degree Found	The text only states: "A valid license as a Professional Planner issued by the New Jersey State Board of Professional Planners." It provides no information about educational prerequisites (associate, bachelor’s, or graduate degree) needed to obtain that license.	The SourceText mentions the existence of a Professional Planner license but lists no degree requirement for obtaining it, so no college degree requirement can be derived from this document.	0.85	987

The text offers several alternative ways to qualify for the job, but when the option involves already holding the Professional Planner license, it does not state any college-degree prerequisite for obtaining that license; therefore, based solely on this source, no degree requirement can be identified.	0.85	984
Professional Planner	https://info.csc.nj.gov/jobannouncements/DefaultJobAnnouncement/ViewNonCompetitiveJobDescription?guid=48fe32f0-f058-4157-9ab2-e7dc1baa5cba	No Degree Found	“Valid license as a Certified Planner in New Jersey issued by the New Jersey Board of Professional Planners preferred.” / “Possession of a current and valid license as a Certified Planner in New Jersey issued by the New Jersey Board of Professional Planners…” (no accompanying degree requirement stated)	The text lists the Professional Planner license as a credential on its own and nowhere specifies that earning this license requires an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree; therefore no college‐degree requirement can be inferred from the provided source.	0.85	966
Professional Planner	https://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/tyler/city-regional-planning-ms/	No Degree Found	The source text references the New Jersey Professional Planner license only briefly (“New Jersey offers its own license for professional planners… Graduates who plan on working in New Jersey can opt to sit for the Professional Planner (PP) exam.”) and provides no statement specifying any college degree requirement for that license.	The text describes an MS program and mentions the NJ Professional Planner exam in passing, but it does not list any educational prerequisites for obtaining the NJ Professional Planner license itself, so no degree requirement can be inferred.	0.9	956
Professional Planner	https://www.morriscountynj.gov/Jobs/Planner-Trainee-Office-of-Planning-and-Preservation?oc_lang=vi	No Degree Found	The only reference to the Professional Planner license states: "Possession of a current and valid license as a Professional Planner in New Jersey issued by the New Jersey Board of Professional Planners may be substituted for the educational requirement."  No educational prerequisites for obtaining that license are provided in the text.

Professional Planner	https://www.morriscountynj.gov/Jobs/Planner-Trainee-Office-of-Planning-and-Preservation?oc_lang=ur	No Degree Found	The text lists degree requirements for the job ("Graduation from an accredited college or university with a Bachelor's degree...") but only says "Possession of a current and valid license as a Professional Planner in New Jersey... may be substituted for the education requirement," without describing any educational prerequisite for obtaining that license itself.	The source text never states what education, if any, is required to obtain the Professional Planner license; it only references the license as an alternative to the job’s degree requirement.

(No educational prerequisites for obtaining that license are specified elsewhere in the text.)

Professional Planner	https://www.morriscountynj.gov/Jobs/Planner-Trainee-Office-of-Planning-and-Preservation?oc_lang=pt	No Degree Found	The text only states that “A posse de uma licença atual e válida como Planejador Profissional em Nova Jersey … pode substituir o requisito de educação.” It provides no educational prerequisites for obtaining that Professional Planner license itself.	The source text is a job posting; while it mentions an existing Professional Planner license could waive the job’s education requirement, it nowhere describes what education is needed to obtain that license, so no college-degree requirement for licensure can be inferred.	0.85	897
Professional Planner	https://www.morriscountynj.gov/Jobs/Planner-Trainee-Office-of-Planning-and-Preservation?oc_lang=zh-CN	No Degree Found	The text only states that "Possession of a current New Jersey Professional Planner license ... may be substituted for the education requirement" but gives no educational prerequisites for obtaining the Professional Planner license itself.

It provides no information on what education, if any, is required to obtain that license.	The source text describes job qualifications and merely notes that holding the Professional Planner license can waive the job’s degree requirement; it does not specify the educational prerequisites for the license itself, leaving the license requirements ambiguous.	0.3	889

No degree requirement for initial licensure is described.	The source text describes job-specific education (a bachelor's or master's) but provides no details about what the New Jersey Board of Professional Planners requires for licensure itself; therefore, no degree requirement can be concluded for the license from this text.	0.85	884

The text provides no details on what education is needed to obtain that license.

Admission to master’s degree programs typically requires a bachelor’s degree.”	The only educational guidance provided states that planners must have at least a bachelor’s (and often a master’s) degree. Because no non-degree pathway is described for New Jersey licensure, the minimum explicitly mentioned credential is a bachelor’s degree.	0.7	873

These passages treat a degree as an optional substitute, not a mandatory prerequisite.	The text outlines experience, course, and exam requirements but only offers an associate degree as an optional way to waive some of those requirements. Because applicants can qualify through experience and the 60-hour course without any college degree, no degree is required for initial licensure.	0.9	1,047.00

The statute merely defines a Registered Dietitian as someone who holds registration with the Commission on Dietetic Registration; it does not list any associate, bachelor’s, or graduate degree requirement for that registration, so no degree requirement can be identified from the provided text.	0.86	1,082.00

The regulation requires the applicant to be a "graduate of an accredited college or university," which, in normal usage, implies completion of an undergraduate (bachelor-level) program, even though the term "bachelor's" is not explicitly stated. Therefore the minimum implied educational requirement is a bachelor's degree.	0.65	1,053.00

The text does not describe what those mandates entail or specify any degree level for the registered dietitian path.	While the article lists a master’s/doctorate requirement for the ‘licensed nutritionist’ route, it states that satisfying external Registered Dietitian (CDR) mandates is an alternate path without detailing those mandates.

The only educational pathway described for eligibility to take the RDN exam—an essential step for licensure—is completion of an ACEND-approved Master of Science program, so the text explicitly links a graduate degree to licensure eligibility.	0.75	833
Registered Dietitian	https://internship.commons.gc.cuny.edu/state-certification-and-licensure/	No Degree Found	The provided text discusses state credentialing, examinations, and supervised practice for dietitians but nowhere specifies that a bachelor's, master's, associate's, or other degree is required.	The SourceText contains no explicit or implicit reference to any college degree requirement for becoming a Registered Dietitian or for New Jersey state licensure; therefore, no degree requirement can be identified from this text.	0.86	830
Registered Dietitian	https://curriculummanagement.oregonstate.edu/master-science-nutrition-professional-dietetics-option-ms	No Degree Found	The text states only that "Successful completion of [the RDN] exam is a prerequisite for obtaining Dietitian licensure" and that the listed Master’s program "is designed to meet the educational requirements," but it never specifies that any degree (Associate’s, Bachelor’s, or Master’s) is legally required for licensure.	The passage describes one Master’s program that satisfies licensure education requirements and notes the RDN exam requirement, yet nowhere does it state a statutory or regulatory mandate that applicants must hold a particular degree level; therefore, no explicit or implicit degree requirement can be determined from this source.	0.73	798
Registered Dietitian	https://nutrition.rutgers.edu/dietetics-option/faq.html	No Degree Found	The provided text discusses majors in dietetics, supervised practice, and post-baccalaureate options but never states that a specific associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree is required in order to obtain Registered Dietitian licensure.	The SourceText offers general academic guidance and mentions terms like “baccalaureate” and “post-baccalaureate” in passing, yet it never sets an explicit educational prerequisite for initial licensure as a Registered Dietitian; therefore, no degree requirement can be concluded from this text.	0.83	787
Registered Dietitian	https://catalog.rowan.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=9&poid=4480&returnto=548	Could Not Determine	The text only states that “The M.S. in Nutrition & Dietetics … prepares graduates to be eligible to take the national exam towards earning the Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist (RDN) credential,” but it never says a master’s (or any specific degree) is a mandatory prerequisite for licensure; it simply describes one university pathway.	The source discusses a Rowan University M.S. program that can make graduates eligible for the RDN exam, yet it does not explicitly say that obtaining this or any other degree level is legally required for initial licensure, leaving the actual statutory requirement unclear.	0.3	783
Registered Dietitian	https://www.nutritioned.org/new-jersey-nutritionist/	No Degree Found	The source text outlines degree requirements for becoming a licensed nutritionist (master’s or doctoral degree) but never specifies any educational requirement for the separate credential of a Registered Dietitian/Registered Dietitian Nutritionist; no degree level is stated for that license.	Because the excerpt provides no explicit or implicit educational prerequisites for obtaining a Registered Dietitian license in New Jersey, the minimum degree requirement cannot be inferred; therefore, it is recorded as no degree found in the text.	0.88	777

The text is a description of an associate-level academic program and merely notes that students often transfer to a BS program; it provides no official licensure requirements, so the minimum degree needed for a Registered Dietitian license cannot be determined from this source.	0.32	771
Registered Dietitian	https://nutrition.rutgers.edu/dietetics-option/mission-goals.html	No Degree Found	The SourceText discusses preparation through a “DPD program” and supervised practice leading to the CDR exam, but nowhere mentions an associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, or other specific degree requirement.

Instructional Certificate	https://www.nj.gov/education/certification/teachers/	No Degree Found	The text only states that a CEAS is issued to someone who "has completed a teacher preparation program" and a CE to someone who "meets the basic requirements for certification, including academic study"; it never specifies that an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree is required.	The provided official text outlines certification types and mentions completion of a teacher preparation program and academic study but nowhere explicitly (or implicitly) requires any college degree level, so no degree requirement can be concluded from this source.	0.87	1,045.00

The section is a general reciprocity statute and, while mentioning education/training equivalency, it never indicates that a particular collegiate degree (Associate’s, Bachelor’s, PharmD, etc.) is required for a Registered Pharmacist or any other license; therefore, no degree requirement can be identified from this text.	0.86	823

Veterinary Licence	https://legiscan.com/NJ/text/S3338/id/3007022	No Degree Found	The text only states that a participant must be a “veterinarian licensed, or eligible to be licensed, to practice in this State,” and nowhere specifies any educational credential (associate’s, bachelor’s, or veterinary doctorate) required to obtain that license.	The bill concerns a loan-redemption program and lists licensure and residency criteria but does not lay out any educational prerequisites for obtaining the veterinary license itself; therefore no college-degree requirement can be derived from this source text.	0.86	820
Veterinary Licence	https://www.kent.edu/kso/new-jersey	No Degree Found	Completion of Kent State's -accredited program meets educational requirements to apply for licensure as a Veterinary Technician in New Jersey.	The only educational prerequisite mentioned is completion of an accredited program; the text never states that an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate/professional degree is required.	0.8	784
Veterinary Licence	https://www.mercy.edu/media/veterinary-tech-licensure-sara	No Degree Found	The text references a "Veterinary Technology Program" and states it "meets the state educational requirements for licensure" but does not specify that an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate/professional degree is required.	The source details program compliance with state requirements but nowhere identifies any explicit or implicit college-degree level prerequisite for initial licensure in New Jersey.	0.87	784
Veterinary Licence	https://www.animallaw.info/statutes/us/new-jersey?order=title&sort=asc	No Degree Found	No portion of the provided text specifies any educational degree requirement for obtaining a veterinary license; the citation "NJSA 45:16-1 to 45:16-18" is merely described as containing licensing requirements without detailing them.	The SourceText lists statutes related to veterinary practice but does not quote or summarize any explicit or implicit educational prerequisites, so no degree requirement can be inferred.	0.85	759
Clinical Laboratory Technician License	https://mycareer.nj.gov/training/47166	No Degree Found	No educational requirement for obtaining a Clinical Laboratory Technician license is specified anywhere in the text; it only describes a college program (“The Associate of Applied Science prepares students for a career as a medical laboratory technician”) without stating that this or any degree is mandatory for licensure.	The source material discusses an academic program but never identifies any degree, including that program’s associate degree, as a prerequisite for state licensure, so no degree requirement can be inferred for the license itself.	0.85	1,001.00
Cosmetologist-Hairstylist License	https://mycareer.nj.gov/training/26047	No Degree Found	"Prerequisites: 18 years of age or older and possess a high school diploma." No mention of associate's, bachelor's, or graduate degree requirements appears elsewhere in the text.	The source lists only a high-school diploma and training hours as prerequisites for licensure preparation; it does not reference any college degree requirement.	0.9	1,001.00
Professional Nurse	https://www.nj.gov/education/certification/edsrvs/endorsementsedsrvs/3000S.shtml	No Degree Found	The text only states, "A current New Jersey registered professional nurse license issued by the New Jersey State Board of Nursing" without describing any educational prerequisites for that license. The sole degree reference—"Hold a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university"—pertains to the separate School Nurse certificate, not to obtaining the professional nurse license itself.	The SourceText specifies no educational requirement for the registered professional nurse license; the bachelor’s degree applies exclusively to the School Nurse certificate, so no degree requirement can be attributed to the professional nurse license based on this text.	0.85	1,001.00
Water Plant Operator License	https://www.nj.gov/dep/watersupply/wsw.html	No Degree Found	The SourceText states: “Eligibility for a Licensed Operator in New Jersey requires a combination of experience, educational course prerequisites and passing an exam.” Nowhere in the provided text is an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate/professional degree mentioned as a prerequisite.	The excerpt outlines experience, course, and exam requirements but never specifies any college‐level degree, so no degree requirement can be inferred.	0.9	948
Water Plant Operator License	https://civil.njit.edu/continuing-education	No Degree Found	“Completion of this NJDEP approved training course, a high school diploma (or equivalency certificate) and one year of operating experience are required in order for you to be eligible to take the exams for T1, W1, S1, and C1 licenses.”	The text specifies that only a high school diploma (or equivalent) plus the training course and experience are required; there is no mention of any associate, bachelor’s, or graduate degree.	0.9	904
Weighmaster	https://www.simplyhired.com/search?q=weigh+master&l=new+jersey	Could Not Determine	The source text only lists general job postings and makes no reference to the statutory or regulatory educational prerequisites for obtaining a New Jersey Weighmaster license.	Because the text contains no information about the licensing criteria itself, it is impossible to tell whether any college degree is required for initial licensure as a Weighmaster in New Jersey.	0.3	0
